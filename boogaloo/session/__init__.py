""" The `session` module contains classes which describe the state of a concrete game session. These classes are
instantiated based upon a StateTreeDefinition when the game is started.
Most classes in the `definition` module have a concrete counterpart in the `session` module.
The `session_factory` module is used to create a `session` based on a `definition`.
